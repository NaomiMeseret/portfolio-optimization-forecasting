# 📈 Portfolio Optimization with Time Series Forecasting

> Predicting market trends to optimize investment portfolios using advanced forecasting models

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This project helps financial advisors and investors make smarter portfolio decisions by predicting future stock prices. We combine **classical statistical models** (ARIMA/SARIMA) with **deep learning** (LSTM) to forecast market movements and optimize asset allocation.

Think of it as a data-driven crystal ball for investments—but grounded in rigorous statistical analysis rather than guesswork.

## 💡 The Big Idea

**The Challenge:** Predicting stock prices is notoriously difficult (thanks to the Efficient Market Hypothesis), but we can still forecast volatility, identify trends, and use these insights as inputs for better portfolio management.

**Our Approach:** 
- Analyze historical patterns in financial data
- Build multiple forecasting models to compare performance
- Use predictions to inform portfolio allocation strategies
- Balance risk and return across different asset classes

## 📊 Assets We Analyze

- **🚗 TSLA** (Tesla) - High-growth, high-volatility stock
- **🛡️ BND** (Vanguard Bond ETF) - Low-risk stability anchor
- **📦 SPY** (S&P 500 ETF) - Diversified market exposure

Together, these represent a balanced portfolio: growth potential, stability, and market diversification.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Methods

- **Time Series Analysis:** ARIMA/SARIMA models for statistical forecasting
- **Deep Learning:** LSTM neural networks for pattern recognition
- **Risk Metrics:** VaR, Sharpe Ratio, volatility analysis
- **Data Science:** Python, pandas, TensorFlow, statsmodels

## 🚀 Quick Start
